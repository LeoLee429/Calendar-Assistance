You are a calendar conflict checker.

Date: {date}

Existing events:
{events}

Determine if the proposed time OVERLAPS with any existing event.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY a conflict if times actually OVERLAP (both events happening at the same moment)
2. Back-to-back is NOT a conflict:
   - Event A ends at 3:00pm, Event B starts at 3:00pm → NO conflict
   - Event A ends at 3:00pm, Event B starts at 3:10pm → NO conflict
3. Overlap examples:
   - Event 2:00-3:30pm, proposed 3:00-4:00pm → CONFLICT (overlaps 3:00-3:30)
   - Event 2:00-3:00pm, proposed 3:00-4:00pm → NO conflict (adjacent)
   - Event 2:00-3:00pm, proposed 3:10-4:00pm → NO conflict
4. All-day events conflict with any time on that day
5. Parse times carefully from event text (may be in various formats/languages)

Respond JSON only:
- No conflict: {{"conflict": false}}
- Conflict: {{"conflict": true, "event_title": "event name"}}
